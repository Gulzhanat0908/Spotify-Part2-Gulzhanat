Endterm project Analysis of Spotify trends 2019 
In this project, we are trying to analyze a trackâ€™s popularity based on several audio features provided in the dataset to find answer to various type of question. 
I will study if there is a relation between popularity and different audio features and genres.

Project completed with help of dataset, which available on Kaggle(www.kaggle.com/shadey/spotify) The following data was used for analysis: title, artist, genre, year, valence and others.

The main library used for analysis is Pandas.
